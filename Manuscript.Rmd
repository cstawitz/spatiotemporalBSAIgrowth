## Methods

We analyzed mean length-at-age for a number of Eastern Bering Sea species: walleye pollock (*Gadus chalcogrammus*), Pacific cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*), and arrowtooth flounder (*Atheresthes stomas*). Species were chosen as they have databases of fishery-independent length and age data dating back to 1982, substantial information on diet preferences, and are commercially and/or ecologically important to the region. We fit a spatio-temporal model to average length by year and region for each species using the VAST (Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal) R package incorporating environmental covariates hypothesized to be important drivers of body size based on previous research. 

# Data

Fishery-independent length and age data were extracted from the Bering Sea survey conducted annually by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s trawl survey. The data extracted included measured length, age, sex, and weight of each sampled fish, in addition to haul-specific data on the start latitude, longitude, and survey station, temperature and depth, and gear-specific data on the gear type and net width used to collect fish. 

# Model fitting

We calculated average length-at-age for each year at each survey station, where each survey station represents a unique latitude and longitude pairing from which fish were collected. In some years, ages were collected based on length-stratified sampling, which aged equal numbers of fish from each pre-specified length group. Length groups were pre-specified based on 1 cm bins (confirm in sampling protocol documents). To obtain accurate estimates of population length-at-age, we corrected for the effect of length-stratified ageing as in Bettoli and Miranda (1992). The corrected mean length for each survey station and each year of data for each species *i* was our response variable.



## Results

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
